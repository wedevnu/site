The WeDev website


## Things to do:
- a home page with the club’s mission statement, 
- upcoming events something for new members to sign up or join the mailing list (have a Google form rn that maybe we could include on a website via an iFrame?). 
- An “About the Club” section could explain how and why WeDev was started, introduce the leadership team, and share the club’s goals. 
- A “Projects” page could showcase past and ongoing club projects, especially the real-world apps being developed, while offering opportunities for others to contribute.
-  A “Resources” page might link to tutorials, coding guides, and Apple’s developer resources for Swift, iOS, and visionOS, with a “Getting Started with iOS Development” section for beginners (have a lot of favorites for this).
- A calendar page could display the schedule of events. A “Join Us” or “Contact Us” page would provide forms for new members, leadership interest, or general inquiries, along with links to social media and the mailing list.
